# plantr

A React web app to help you plan your vegetable garden.

## Functionality still to come...

- On `HomePage`, change `Plant it!` to a checkmark to indicate that it's already planted
- Allow user to create/edit profile (username, email address, hardiness zone)

## Other todos

- Change `table` to `form` on `Your Notes`
- Add more details to `About` page
- Add notifications to the UI for signup when email or username is already in use
- Make code more DRY
- Use `async/await`
- Change alert method for successfully planting something vs when it's already planted
- Finalize `README`
