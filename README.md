# Flora Files

A React web app to help you plan your vegetable garden.

## Functionality still to come...

- Create `Search` functionality on `HomePage`
- Toggle icons according to what is recommended for the user's USDA hardiness zone
- On `HomePage`, change `Plant it!` to a checkmark to indicate that it's already planted
- Allow user to create/edit profile (username, email address, hardiness zone)
- Allow user to upload his/her own photos

## Other todos

- Change `tables` to something else?
- Implement word wrap on `Your Notes` table
- Add more details to `About` page
- Make code more DRY
- Use async/await
- Change alert method for successfully planting something vs when it's already planted
